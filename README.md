### PURPOSE

The purpose of this project is to provide a quick and convenient way for a computer user to obtain a purely random password that provides specific criteria, i.e., number of characters and type of characters: digits, lower case letters, upper case letters, and a selection of special symbols. 

### REQUIREMENTS

The requirement was to create this password generator; HTML, CSS, and Javascript files were provided. The instructions were to prompt the user to enter the length of the password (between 8-128); and the type of characters mentioned above. I took this direction in the generic sense of prompt--to give the user instructions on what to do, not literally use prompts to receive their requirements.

I did this in the form of simple instructions at the top of the page, as can be seen in the screenshot below.

I simply ask the user how many characters they need in their password, between 8 and 128. I then ask "Your Password includes? You must select at least one option:". I included this last statement to signal the format the user must use in order to obtain their password. They they check the boxes associate with the character types they prefer/need. Once their number is entered in the box, and the character types are checked, they simply press the "Generate Password" button. The resultant password then appears in the window.

### LESSONS

I learned four very important lessons. 1) Whatever you imagine, you can create using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I tried to put myself in place of an everyday internet user. They want a simple application that is straightforward, easy to use, pleasant to look at, and easy to use. I then designed the front end of the application with these things in mind.

2) Javascript is a very difficult language, especially having just been introduced to it. I liken it to a very difficult spoken language that you've never heard before. That said, it is a robust language that allows programmers several approaches to solving the problems they've been given.

3) Pseudocoding is extremely important with Javascript. This point has been stressed. The impulse is to nod your head, say "yeah yeah" and then move forward with coding. However, a half hour to an hour of planning and sketching and designing in pseudocode can save you HOURS at the back end of your project. I did pseduocode before beginning the project; however, I strayed away from my plans and got stuck in certain parts, where I didn't know how to proceed.

4) Stick to the plan you've created. If your plan isn't good enough, make it better. This ties in to #3. As mentioned, it's much better to take more time mapping your plan and then taking the time to pseudocode it before writing a single line of code. 

### SHOUT OUTS

Much thanks to the TAs for this course. Chris Sannar, Andrew Tirpok, Mason Short (you're a beast), and Andi, who didn't specifically help me with this project, but convinced me to not take a sledgehammer to my computer. Lastly and not leastly are AJ, Collin, and especially Diego. Working together is the only way we're going to make it through. Thanks y'all.
